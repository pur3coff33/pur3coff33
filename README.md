Hi there! 

I'm a junior programmer with a strong foundation in computer science principles and a passion for building modern web applications. 
I have experience with ReactJS, Angular, and Node.js, and am familiar with technologies such as Firebase and MongoDB for building scalable and reliable applications.

I am constantly learning and expanding my skillset, and am always looking for new challenges to tackle. 
I have completed a number of personal projects and am eager to work on real-world projects to gain practical experience in the field.

If you have a project that requires expertise in ReactJS, Angular, Node.js, Firebase, or MongoDB, I would love to be considered as a potential member of your team. 
Feel free to reach out and let's see how I can contribute to your project!
